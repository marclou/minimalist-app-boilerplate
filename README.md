# A minimalist React App + Express API with basic JWT authentication flow

Try the app [here](https://minimalist-app-boilerplate.herokuapp.com)
(it might take 7 seconds to load as the free Heroku dyno I use for this app falls asleep when not used)


## Get started

1. Clone repo
2. Run `npm install` on /client, /server AND / folders
3. Check /client & /server READ.me(s) for instructions per app

Note: each app (client & server) has its own .env file
Note: deployment scripts are for Heroku Dyno hosting
